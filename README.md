# Make-America-Swole-Again


## Welcome to M.A.S.A

Before launching into our code, we request that you install the following: 

```
npm install
```

and 

```
bower install 
```

Start up the Express server on port 8080 with npm start.

## Our Motivation

You think this is another workout app? 

WRONG!

We wanted to create an app that inspires and tracks user's progress as they hit the gym to become so swole. Not only did we want to make an app that was appealing to the eye, but also helpful on the user's path to being as strong and healthy as they can be. 

Y'all it's going to be YUGE! And even more important, so are you!

## The Database

M.A.S.A uses a PostgreSQL for its relational user and exercise data. In the server folder there are four schemas tables: users, users info, exercises, and workout history. Something to note is that users table contains information about the user's account, while the user info table holds information about the user's physicality, such as sex, weight, and age. 

For mac users we recommend downloading the PostgreSQL app in order to more easily access and manipulate the database.
